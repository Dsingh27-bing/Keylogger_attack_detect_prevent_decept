This Project is full grown project which focuses on Keylogger Cyber Attack. 
This project is divided into four parts namely Attack, Detection, Prevention and Deception. 
These four parts have separate functionality and codes written in Python.

In <b>keylogger Attack</b>, the user will have the keylogger application installed behind a trojan horse and then all the keystrokes will be sent to the attacker via email.
<br>In <b>Detection</b>, I did low level detection of the attack by detecting the network outbounds of tcp/ip protocols, file generation corresponding to keystrokes.
<br>In <b>Prevention</b>, I used both the detection method and made a password manager in order for the user to avoid typing anything on the keyboard.
<br>In <b>Deception</b>, I wanted to fool the attacker, hence I made a virtual keyboard which inserts the text on the screen and generates random letters which act like keyboard strokes.
